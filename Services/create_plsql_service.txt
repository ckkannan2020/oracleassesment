--Use the Service in Your PL/SQL Block
--When you want to assign a specific PL/SQL block to use this dedicated service, you can use the DBMS_SESSION package to set the current session's service to CustomerManagement:

create or replace procedure prc_set_service as
    v_customer_id NUMBER;
    v_product_id NUMBER := 101; -- Assume product ID 101
    v_quantity NUMBER := 2;
    v_total_cost NUMBER;
    v_book_price NUMBER;
BEGIN
    -- Switch the session to use the dedicated service for managing customers
    DBMS_SESSION.SET_SERVICE('CustomerManagement');
    
    -- Start a transaction to ensure all operations are atomic
    SAVEPOINT start_transaction;
    
    -- Example: Inserting a new customer record
    INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name, email_office, email_personal, family_members)
    VALUES (customer_seq.NEXTVAL, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@company.com', 'john.doe@gmail.com', 4)
    RETURNING customer_id INTO v_customer_id;

    -- Example: Fetch product price and calculate total cost
    SELECT book_price INTO v_book_price
    FROM products
    WHERE product_id = v_product_id
    FOR UPDATE;

    v_total_cost := v_book_price * v_quantity;
    
    -- Insert product purchase record
    INSERT INTO product_purchases (customer_id, product_id, quantity, total_cost)
    VALUES (v_customer_id, v_product_id, v_quantity, v_total_cost);

    -- Commit the transaction
    COMMIT;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Rollback in case of any error
        ROLLBACK TO start_transaction;
        RAISE;
END;
